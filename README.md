# Xyndril Agent Kit

ðŸ§ª This project is the official testbed for the Xyndril programming language.
All modules will be progressively migrated to Xyndril syntax.

Reference agent architecture and tools for the Xyndril language ecosystem. See docs/ for detailed documentation.

## Migration Plan
- XynCrawl â†’ XynHarvester â†’ XynSight
- Python and Xyndril versions will initially coexist
- Final goal: pure Xyndril-based agent system
