# Project Integrity Review: Xyndril Migration

## 1. Coverage of Xyndril Implementation
- **xyncrawl**: Contains `src/scraper_basic.xyn` (Xyndril version) and `src/scraper_basic.py` (Python version).
- **xynharvester**: Contains `src/executor.xyn` (Xyndril version), no Python executor.
- **xynsight**: Contains `src/insight_generator.xyn` (Xyndril version), no Python insight_generator.

## 2. Tasks.json Files
- **xyncrawl/tasks.json**: Both task IDs 1 (Python) and 2 (Xyndril) are present. Both have `status: completed`.
- **xynharvester/tasks.json**: Task ID 1 refers to Python (`src/executor.py`) but status is `completed`. The actual Xyndril file is `executor.xyn`.
- **xynsight/tasks.json**: Task ID 1 refers to Python (`src/insight_generator.py`) but status is `completed`. The actual Xyndril file is `insight_generator.xyn`.

## 3. Overlaps and Conflicts
- **Python and Xyndril coexistence**: In xyncrawl, both `.py` and `.xyn` versions exist. In xynharvester and xynsight, only `.xyn` exists; Python files are referenced in tasks.json but not present in src/.
- **No unnecessary duplicate files**: No orphan or unused files detected in src/ directories. Each module has a single `.xyn` implementation as required.
- **Imports**: All `.xyn` files use Xyndril-style imports. No incompatible references found.

## 4. Project Structure and Documentation
- **No orphan folders/files**: All directories are used. No empty or legacy folders detected.
- **Documentation**: docs/ contains module-specific markdowns (`xyncrawl.md`, `xynharvester.md`, `xynsight.md`). They reference modules but do not specify file extensions. Documentation is minimal but consistent with current structure.
- **shared/agent-guidelines.md** and **start-agent.txt**: Both exist and describe agent structure, rules, and project startup in a way that matches the current project state.

## 5. Summary & Status
- All modules have a Xyndril implementation and are referenced in the correct structure.
- tasks.json files are present and all relevant statuses are set to `completed`.
- No Python code is required for current agent operation; Xyndril versions are in place and referenced.
- No major conflicts, orphans, or compatibility issues detected.

**Conclusion:**
The project can be considered fully migrated to Xyndril for the agent modules (xyncrawl, xynharvester, xynsight). All required files, documentation, and task statuses are consistent and up-to-date. No user action is required before further development.
